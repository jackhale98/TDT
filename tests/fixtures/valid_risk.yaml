description: |
  Risk of thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery pack during
  charging or high-temperature operation.

failure_mode: |
  Battery cells exceed thermal limits causing cascading
  thermal runaway across the pack.

cause: |
  Internal short circuit, overcharging, or external heat source
  causing cell temperature to exceed safe limits.

effect: |
  Fire, explosion, or toxic gas release endangering users
  and damaging equipment.
