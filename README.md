# PDT - Plain-text Product Development Toolkit

A CLI tool for managing product development artifacts as plain-text YAML files. PDT provides structured tracking of requirements, risks, tests, and other entities with full traceability and validation.

## Features

- **Plain-text YAML files** - Human-readable, git-friendly, diff-able
- **Schema validation** - JSON Schema validation with helpful error messages
- **Traceability** - Link entities together and generate traceability matrices
- **ULID-based IDs** - Unique, sortable identifiers for all entities
- **Short ID aliases** - Use `REQ@1`, `RISK@2`, etc. instead of typing long IDs
- **Beautiful error messages** - Line numbers, context, and actionable suggestions
- **FMEA Risk Management** - Built-in support for Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
- **BOM Management** - Components and assemblies with supplier tracking
- **Tolerance Analysis** - Features, mates, and stackups with worst-case, RSS, and Monte Carlo analysis

## Installation

```bash
cargo install pdt
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/pdt.git
cd pdt
cargo build --release
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new project
pdt init

# Create a requirement
pdt req new --title "Operating Temperature Range" --type input

# List all requirements (shows REQ@N short IDs)
pdt req list

# Show a specific requirement using short ID
pdt req show REQ@1                 # Use prefixed short ID from list
pdt req show REQ-01HC2             # Or partial ID match

# Create a risk
pdt risk new --title "Battery Overheating" -t design

# Validate all project files
pdt validate
```

## Short IDs

After running `list` commands, PDT assigns entity-prefixed short IDs (`REQ@1`, `RISK@1`, etc.) to entities:

```bash
$ pdt req list
@       ID               TYPE     TITLE                                STATUS     PRIORITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQ@1   REQ-01HC2JB7...  input    Operating Temperature Range          approved   high
REQ@2   REQ-01HC2JB8...  output   Thermal Management Specification     draft      high

$ pdt risk list
@        ID                TYPE      TITLE                            STATUS     LEVEL    RPN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RISK@1   RISK-01HC2JB7...  design    Battery Overheating              review     medium   108

# Use prefixed short IDs instead of full IDs
pdt req show REQ@1
pdt risk show RISK@1
pdt link add REQ@1 --type verified_by TEST@1
pdt trace from REQ@1
```

Short IDs are persistent per entity type - the same entity keeps its short ID across list commands.
This enables cross-entity linking (e.g., linking `REQ@1` to `TEST@1`).

## Project Structure

After `pdt init`, your project will have:

```

  Internal short circuit, overcharging, or external heat source
  causing cell temperature to exceed safe limits.

effect: |
  Fire, explosion, or toxic gas release endangering users
  and damaging equipment.

## Tolerance Format

PDT uses `plus_tol` and `minus_tol` fields instead of the `±` symbol (which is hard to type):

```yaml
# Correct: 10.0 +0.1/-0.05
dimensions:
  - name: "diameter"
    nominal: 10.0
    plus_tol: 0.1     # Positive deviation allowed
    minus_tol: 0.05   # Negative deviation allowed (stored as positive number)
```

Both values are stored as **positive numbers**. The actual tolerance range is:
- Maximum: `nominal + plus_tol` = 10.1
- Minimum: `nominal - minus_tol` = 9.95

## Validation

PDT validates files against JSON Schema with detailed error messages:

```
error[pdt::schema::validation]: Schema validation failed
  --> requirements/inputs/REQ-01HC2.pdt.yaml:8:1
   |
 8 | status: pending
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Invalid enum value
   |
  help: Valid values: draft, review, approved, released, obsolete
```

## Status Workflow

```
draft → review → approved → released
                    ↓           ↓
                 obsolete ← ← ← ┘
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| draft | Initial creation, still being written |
| review | Ready for stakeholder review |
| approved | Signed off and baselined |
| released | Released to production/manufacturing |
| obsolete | No longer applicable |

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| critical | Safety, regulatory, blocking requirements |
| high | Core functionality, key differentiators |
| medium | Standard features, quality of life |
| low | Nice to have, future considerations |

## Risk Assessment (FMEA)

PDT uses FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) methodology:

### FMEA Ratings (1-10 scale)

| Factor | 1 | 10 |
|--------|---|-----|
| **Severity** | Minimal impact | Catastrophic, safety hazard |
| **Occurrence** | Very unlikely | Almost certain |
| **Detection** | Always detected | Cannot be detected |

### Risk Priority Number (RPN)

RPN = Severity x Occurrence x Detection (range: 1-1000)

| RPN Range | Risk Level | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1-50 | Low | Monitor, no immediate action needed |
| 51-150 | Medium | Plan mitigations, track progress |
| 151-400 | High | Prioritize mitigations, escalate |
| 401+ | Critical | Immediate action required |

### Mitigation Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **prevention** | Reduces occurrence probability |
| **detection** | Improves ability to detect before failure |

## Test Engineering

### Verification vs Validation

| Type | Purpose | Question |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Verification** | Did we build it right? | Confirms design outputs meet inputs |
| **Validation** | Did we build the right thing? | Confirms product meets user needs |

### V-Model Test Levels

| Level | Tests Against | Scope |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Unit** | Detailed design | Individual components |
| **Integration** | Architecture design | Component interactions |
| **System** | System requirements | Complete system |
| **Acceptance** | User needs | End-user scenarios |

### IADT Methods

Tests can use different verification methods (Inspection, Analysis, Demonstration, Test):

| Method | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Inspection** | Visual examination | Workmanship, labeling, documentation |
| **Analysis** | Calculation/simulation | Complex systems, safety-critical |
| **Demonstration** | Show functionality | User interface, simple operations |
| **Test** | Measured execution | Performance, environmental, stress |

## Tolerance Analysis

PDT supports three analysis methods for tolerance stackups:

### Worst-Case Analysis

Assumes all dimensions are at their worst-case limits simultaneously:
- **Min result**: All positive contributors at minimum, all negative at maximum
- **Max result**: All positive contributors at maximum, all negative at minimum
- **Conservative** but often overly pessimistic

### RSS (Root Sum Square) Analysis

Statistical analysis assuming normal distributions:
- Calculates mean and 3σ spread
- Computes Cpk (process capability index)
- Estimates yield percentage
- More realistic than worst-case for multi-contributor stacks

| Cpk | Yield | Quality Level |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| 0.33 | 68.27% | Poor |
| 0.67 | 95.45% | Marginal |
| 1.0 | 99.73% | Capable |
| 1.33 | 99.99% | Good |
| 1.67 | 99.9997% | Excellent |
| 2.0 | 99.9999% | Six Sigma |

### Monte Carlo Simulation

Runs thousands of random samples:
- Supports normal, uniform, and triangular distributions
- Provides actual yield percentage
- Reports 95% confidence interval (2.5th to 97.5th percentile)
- Default: 10,000 iterations

```bash
# Run analysis with default iterations
pdt tol analyze TOL@1

# Run with more iterations for higher confidence
pdt tol analyze TOL@1 --iterations 100000
```

### Test Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning | Follow-up |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **pass** | All criteria met | None required |
| **fail** | One or more criteria not met | Action items required |
| **conditional** | Passed with deviations | Document justification |
| **incomplete** | Could not complete test | Reschedule |
| **not_applicable** | Test not applicable | Document rationale |

## Best Practices

### Writing Requirements

- Use **"shall"** for mandatory requirements
- Use **"should"** for recommended requirements
- Use **"may"** for optional requirements
- Be specific and testable
- One requirement per file

### Organizing Requirements

- Use **categories** to group related requirements
- Use **tags** for cross-cutting concerns
- Separate **inputs** from **outputs** in different directories
- Link related requirements with `satisfied_by` relationships
