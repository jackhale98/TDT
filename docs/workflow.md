# TDT Workflow & Collaboration

This document describes the git-integrated workflow features in TDT (Tessera Design Toolkit).

## Overview

TDT provides opt-in workflow commands that help teams collaborate on product data using git and GitHub/GitLab. These features are designed for users who may not be familiar with git, providing a guided experience for common review and approval workflows.

**Key Principle**: These features are completely optional. Git-savvy users can continue using standard git commands directly.

## Status Workflow

All TDT entities follow a common status progression:

```
Draft → Review → Approved → Released
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Initial state, work in progress |
| `review` | Submitted for review (PR created) |
| `approved` | Approved by authorized reviewer |
| `released` | Officially released for use |

## Configuration

Enable workflow features in `.tdt/config.yaml`:

```yaml
workflow:
  enabled: true
  provider: github    # github, gitlab, or none
  auto_commit: true   # Auto-commit status changes
  auto_merge: false   # Merge PR on approval
  base_branch: main   # Target branch for PRs
```

### Configuration Keys

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `workflow.enabled` | Enable workflow commands | `false` |
| `workflow.provider` | Git provider: `github`, `gitlab`, `none` | `none` |
| `workflow.auto_commit` | Auto-commit on status changes | `true` |
| `workflow.auto_merge` | Merge PR automatically on approval | `false` |
| `workflow.base_branch` | Target branch for PRs | `main` |

### Setting via CLI

```bash
# Enable workflow with GitHub
tdt config set workflow.enabled true
tdt config set workflow.provider github

# Enable workflow with GitLab
tdt config set workflow.enabled true
tdt config set workflow.provider gitlab

# Manual mode (no PR integration)
tdt config set workflow.enabled true
tdt config set workflow.provider none
```

## Team Roster

Define team members and their approval permissions in `.tdt/team.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
members:
  - name: "Jane Smith"
    email: "jane@example.com"
    username: "jsmith"
    roles: [engineering, quality]
    active: true

  - name: "Bob Wilson"
    email: "bob@example.com"
    username: "bwilson"
    roles: [quality, management]
    active: true

approval_matrix:
  REQ: [engineering, quality]
  RISK: [quality, management]
  NCR: [quality]
  _release: [management]
```

### Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `engineering` | Can approve technical entities (requirements, components) |
| `quality` | Can approve quality-related entities (risks, NCRs, CAPAs) |
| `management` | Can approve releases and high-level decisions |
| `admin` | Full access to all operations |

### Team Commands

```bash
# Initialize team roster
tdt team init

# Add a team member
tdt team add --name "Jane Smith" --email jane@co.com --username jsmith --roles engineering,quality

# Remove a team member
tdt team remove jsmith

# List team members

RISK@3  RISK   Motor overheating failure    bob         #45

2 items pending your review. Run `tdt approve <id>` to approve.
```

## Provider Integration

### GitHub

TDT uses the `gh` CLI for GitHub integration. Install it from https://cli.github.com and authenticate:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Commands used:
- `gh pr create` - Create pull request
- `gh pr review --approve` - Add approval
- `gh pr merge` - Merge PR
- `gh pr list --search "review-requested:@me"` - List pending reviews

### GitLab

TDT uses the `glab` CLI for GitLab integration. Install it from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli and authenticate:

```bash
glab auth login
```

Commands used:
- `glab mr create` - Create merge request
- `glab mr approve` - Approve MR
- `glab mr merge` - Merge MR
- `glab mr list --reviewer=@me` - List pending reviews

### Manual Mode (No Provider)

Set `provider: none` to use workflow commands without GitHub/GitLab integration:

```bash
tdt submit REQ@1
# → Creates branch, commits, pushes
# → Prints: "Create PR manually at your git provider"
```

## Transparency

All workflow commands support transparency flags:

```bash
# Show what would be done without executing
tdt submit REQ@1 --dry-run

# Print commands as they run
tdt submit REQ@1 --verbose
```

### Example Dry Run

```
$ tdt submit REQ@1 --dry-run

Would execute:
  git checkout -b review/REQ-01KCWY20
  git add requirements/inputs/REQ-01KCWY20.tdt.yaml
  git commit -m "Submit REQ@1: Pump GPM requirement"
  git push -u origin review/REQ-01KCWY20
  gh pr create --title "Submit REQ@1: Pump GPM requirement" --base main

No changes made (dry run).
```

## Full Workflow Example

### Setup

```bash
# Initialize a TDT project with workflow
tdt init myproject
cd myproject

# Enable workflow with GitHub
tdt config set workflow.enabled true
tdt config set workflow.provider github

# Create team roster
tdt team init
tdt team add --name "Jane Smith" --username jsmith --roles engineering,quality
tdt team add --name "Bob Wilson" --username bwilson --roles quality,management
```

### Author Creates and Submits

```bash
# Create a requirement
tdt req new --title "Pump GPM requirement"

# Submit for review
tdt submit REQ@1 -m "Initial pump requirement"
# → Creates branch, commits, pushes, opens PR #42
```

### Reviewer Approves

```bash
# Check pending reviews
tdt review list
# → Shows REQ@1 pending review

# Approve (with merge)
tdt approve REQ@1 --merge
# → Adds approval to PR #42, merges to main
```

### Manager Releases

```bash
# Release the approved requirement
tdt release REQ@1
# → Status: approved → released
```

## Best Practices

### For Teams

1. **Define clear roles** - Set up team roster with appropriate role assignments
2. **Use PRs for visibility** - Keep provider configured for audit trail
3. **Review before release** - Require approval before releasing entities

### For Solo Developers

1. **Minimal config** - Just enable workflow, skip team roster
2. **Use provider: none** - No GitHub/GitLab dependency needed
3. **Status tracking** - Still get status progression benefits

### Git-Savvy Users

Workflow commands are optional. You can always:

```bash
# Use git directly
git add requirements/inputs/REQ-*.yaml
git commit -m "Add requirements"
git push

# Edit status manually in YAML files
# Create PRs through web UI
```
