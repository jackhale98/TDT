# TDT Entity Relationships

This document explains how entities are connected in TDT (Tessera Design Toolkit).

## Overview

TDT uses two types of relationships between entities:

| Type | Purpose | Managed By |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Structural** | Parent-child or composition relationships with attributes (quantity, direction, etc.) | Entity-specific commands or YAML editing |
| **Links** | Simple cross-references for traceability | `tdt link` command |

Understanding the difference helps you model your product data correctly.

## Structural Relationships

Structural relationships are embedded directly in entity data because they carry additional attributes beyond just "A relates to B."

### Assembly → Components (BOM)

Assemblies contain a Bill of Materials with quantities and reference designators:

```yaml
# assembly.yaml
id: ASM-01J...
title: "Main PCB Assembly"
bom:
  - component_id: CMP-01J...    # Resistor
    quantity: 4
    reference_designators: ["R1", "R2", "R3", "R4"]
    notes: "0603 footprint"
  - component_id: CMP-01K...    # Capacitor
    quantity: 2
    reference_designators: ["C1", "C2"]
```

The `quantity` and `reference_designators` attributes are why this is structural, not a link.

### Assembly → Subassemblies

Assemblies can contain other assemblies:

```yaml
# top-level-assembly.yaml
subassemblies:
  - ASM-01J...  # Main PCB
  - ASM-01K...  # Enclosure Assembly
```

### Feature → Component (Parent)

Features belong to a component (required field, not optional):

```yaml
# feature.yaml
id: FEAT-01J...
component: CMP-01J...   # Parent component (required)
title: "Mounting Hole A"
dimensions:
  - name: diameter
    nominal: 10.0
    plus_tol: 0.1
    minus_tol: 0.05
```

### Mate → Features

Mates connect exactly two features with fit analysis:

```yaml
# mate.yaml
id: MATE-01J...
feature_a: FEAT-01J...  # Hole feature
feature_b: FEAT-01K...  # Shaft feature
mate_type: clearance
```

### Stackup → Contributors

Tolerance stackups reference features with direction sense:

```yaml
# stackup.yaml
id: TOL-01J...
contributors:
  - feature: FEAT-01J...
    dimension: diameter
    direction: positive
    distribution: normal
  - feature: FEAT-01K...
    dimension: length
    direction: negative
```

### Quote → Component/Assembly

Quotes reference what they're pricing:

```yaml
# quote.yaml
id: QUOT-01J...
component: CMP-01J...    # OR
assembly: ASM-01J...     # (one or the other)
supplier: SUP-01J...
```

## Link Relationships

Links are simple cross-references stored in the `links` section of entities. They're used for traceability and don't carry additional attributes.

### All Link Types

## Managing Links

### Add a link

```bash
# Basic syntax
tdt link add SOURCE TARGET LINK_TYPE

# Examples
tdt link add REQ@1 TEST@1 verified_by
tdt link add RISK@1 CMP@1 affects
tdt link add CAPA@1 PROC@1 processes_modified

# Add reciprocal automatically with -r
tdt link add REQ@1 TEST@1 verified_by -r
# This adds: REQ@1.verified_by → TEST@1
#       and: TEST@1.verifies → REQ@1
```

### Remove a link

```bash
tdt link remove REQ@1 TEST@1 verified_by
```

Note: To remove reciprocal links, run the command twice with swapped source/target.

### Show links for an entity

```bash
tdt link show REQ@1

# Show only outgoing links
tdt link show REQ@1 --outgoing

# Show only incoming links
tdt link show REQ@1 --incoming
```

### Check for broken links

```bash
tdt link check
```

### View all link types

```bash
tdt link add --help
```

## When to Use Each Type

### Use Structural Relationships When:

- The relationship has attributes (quantity, direction, notes)
- It's a parent-child or composition relationship
- The child entity "belongs to" the parent
- The relationship is required (not optional)

**Examples:**
- Components in an assembly (has quantity)
- Features on a component (feature belongs to component)
- Contributors in a stackup (has direction, distribution)

### Use Links When:

- It's a simple cross-reference for traceability
- The relationship is optional
- You need bidirectional navigation
- The relationship type may change

**Examples:**
- Requirement → Test (verification traceability)
- Risk → Component (what's affected)
- NCR → CAPA (escalation)

## Traceability

Links enable traceability analysis:

```bash
# Coverage report (requirements with/without tests)
tdt trace coverage

# Show only uncovered requirements
tdt trace coverage --uncovered

# Generate traceability matrix
tdt trace matrix

# Export as CSV
tdt trace matrix -o csv > trace.csv

# Export as GraphViz DOT
tdt trace matrix -o dot > trace.dot

# Find orphaned requirements (no links)
tdt trace orphans
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use reciprocal links** (`-r` flag) to maintain bidirectional traceability
2. **Run `tdt link check`** periodically to find broken links
3. **Don't duplicate** structural relationships as links
4. **Be consistent** with link types across your project
5. **Document custom relationships** in your project README
