# PDT Risk Entity (FMEA)

This document describes the Risk entity type in PDT (Plain-text Product Development Toolkit).

## Overview

Risks capture potential failure modes and their analysis using FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) methodology. They help identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout product development.

## Entity Type

- **Prefix**: `RISK`
- **File extension**: `.pdt.yaml`
- **Directories**:
  - `risks/design/` - Design risks (product/component failures)
  - `risks/process/` - Process risks (manufacturing/operational failures)

## FMEA Methodology

### Severity Rating (S)

| Rating | Description | Criteria |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | None | No effect |
| 2-3 | Minor | Slight inconvenience, no safety impact |
| 4-5 | Moderate | Customer dissatisfaction, minor injury possible |
| 6-7 | High | Significant impact, injury possible |
| 8-9 | Very High | Serious injury possible, regulatory non-compliance |
| 10 | Hazardous | Life-threatening, regulatory violation |

### Occurrence Rating (O)

| Rating | Description | Probability |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Remote | < 1 in 1,500,000 |
| 2-3 | Low | 1 in 150,000 - 1 in 15,000 |
| 4-5 | Moderate | 1 in 2,000 - 1 in 400 |
| 6-7 | High | 1 in 80 - 1 in 20 |
| 8-9 | Very High | 1 in 8 - 1 in 3 |
| 10 | Almost Certain | > 1 in 2 |

### Detection Rating (D)

| Rating | Description | Criteria |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Almost Certain | Controls will almost certainly detect |
| 2-3 | High | High likelihood of detection |
| 4-5 | Moderate | Moderate likelihood of detection |
| 6-7 | Low | Low likelihood of detection |
| 8-9 | Very Low | Very low likelihood of detection |
| 10 | Undetectable | No known controls can detect |

### Risk Priority Number (RPN)

RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection

| RPN Range | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1-50 | Low | Monitor, document |
| 51-150 | Medium | Plan mitigations, track progress |
| 151-400 | High | Prioritize mitigations, management review |
| 401-1000 | Critical | Immediate action, escalate to leadership |

## Risk Mitigation

### Mitigation Types

1. **Prevention** - Reduces occurrence probability
   - Design changes
   - Material selection
   - Process controls
   - Training

2. **Detection** - Improves ability to detect before failure
   - Inspection methods
   - Testing procedures
   - Monitoring systems
   - Alarms/alerts

### Mitigation Workflow

```
proposed → in_progress → completed → verified
```

1. **proposed**: Mitigation identified but not started
2. **in_progress**: Implementation underway
3. **completed**: Implementation finished
4. **verified**: Effectiveness confirmed through testing

## Link Management

```bash
# Link risk to a requirement
pdt link add RISK-01HC2 --type related_to REQ-01HC3

# Link risk to mitigation design output
pdt link add RISK-01HC2 --type mitigated_by REQ-01HC4

# Link risk to verification test
pdt link add RISK-01HC2 --type verified_by TEST-01HC5

# Show all links for a risk
pdt link show RISK-01HC2

# Check for broken links
pdt link check
```

## Traceability

```bash
# Show what depends on a risk
pdt trace from RISK-01HC2

# Show what a risk depends on
pdt trace to RISK-01HC2

# Find unlinked risks
pdt trace orphans --type risk

# Risk coverage report
pdt trace coverage --type risk
```

## Validation

Risks are validated against a JSON Schema. Run validation with:

```bash
# Validate all project files
pdt validate

# Validate specific file
pdt validate risks/design/RISK-01HC2JB7SMQX7RS1Y0GFKBHPTD.pdt.yaml

# Validate only risks
pdt validate --entity-type risk
```

### Validation Rules

1. **ID Format**: Must match `RISK-[A-Z0-9]{26}` pattern
2. **Type**: Must be `design` or `process`
3. **Title**: Required, 1-200 characters
4. **Description**: Required, non-empty
5. **Status**: Must be one of: `draft`, `review`, `approved`, `released`, `obsolete`
6. **Severity/Occurrence/Detection**: Must be 1-10 if provided
7. **RPN**: Must be 1-1000 if provided
8. **Risk Level**: Must be one of: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`
9. **No Additional Properties**: Unknown fields are not allowed

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Risk Descriptions

1. **Be specific** - Describe the exact failure scenario
2. **Include context** - When/where does this risk apply?
3. **Quantify when possible** - Use numbers, ranges, thresholds
4. **Separate cause from effect** - Don't conflate root cause with impact

### Organizing Risks

1. **Use categories** to group related risks (electrical, mechanical, software, etc.)
2. **Use tags** for cross-cutting concerns (safety, regulatory, customer-facing)
3. **Separate design from process** risks in different directories
4. **Link to requirements** to maintain traceability

### Risk Review Process

1. **Initial Assessment**: Create risk with preliminary FMEA ratings
2. **Team Review**: Validate ratings with cross-functional team
3. **Mitigation Planning**: Identify and assign mitigation actions
4. **Implementation**: Track mitigation progress
5. **Re-assessment**: Update ratings after mitigations are verified
6. **Approval**: Move to approved status when acceptable

### RPN Reduction Strategies

To reduce RPN, focus on:

1. **Severity** - Often fixed by design; may require fundamental changes
2. **Occurrence** - Add prevention controls, improve design robustness
3. **Detection** - Add inspection, testing, monitoring systems

Priority: Focus on high-severity risks first, then high-RPN risks.

## JSON Schema

The full JSON Schema for risks is embedded in PDT and available at:

```
pdt/schemas/risk.schema.json
```

Key schema properties:

- `additionalProperties: false` - No unknown fields allowed
- `minLength` constraints on title and description
- `maxLength: 200` on title
- `minimum: 1, maximum: 10` on severity, occurrence, detection
- `minimum: 1, maximum: 1000` on rpn
- `format: date-time` on created
- `pattern` validation on ID field
